DualLM317BenchSupply
====================

A simple adjustable voltage, current limited bench power supply using two LM317 regulators (KiCAD schematic and PCB layout).

## Status:

A small number of the v1 revision of the PCB design has been manufactured.  These had a manufacturing error which shorted the supply to ground, so v2 is in the works and will be sent to seeedstudio soon.

## Board Revision v2

* KiCAD files: https://github.com/pepaslabs/DualLM317BenchSupply/archive/v2.0.zip
* Assembly Instructions: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s301/sh/98922a1c-4789-4eff-8265-b3d52353a5f1/38aa0f58f0495949719a24fac0aefa83

## Board Revision v1

A run of five v1 boards was ordered, but they suffered from a manufacturing defect which shorted a pad to ground.  Thus, this revision was never publicly for sale.
