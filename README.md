DualLM317BenchSupply
====================

A simple adjustable voltage, current limited bench power supply using two LM317 regulators (KiCAD schematic and PCB layout).

## Status:

A small number of the v1 revision of the PCB design has been manufactured.  These had a manufacturing error which shorted the supply to ground, so v2 is in the works and will be sent to seeedstudio soon.
